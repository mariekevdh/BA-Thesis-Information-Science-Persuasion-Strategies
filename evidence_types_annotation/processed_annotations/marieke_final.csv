This is correct but is either hypocrite or oblivious. Do you go to the homeless guy in the corner of your street to offer him food every time you eat? Clean every time you shower? Do anything at all for the millions and millions who suffer around the world? If yes, congrats, you're the exception, but if no, pinpointing suffering child seems problematic

&gt; Creating another life results in increased ecological/environmental stress on the already overpopulated planet.

Again, correct, but only if you're a state. You, as an individual, is irrelevant. Regardless how much you consume, you won't dent Earth's resources

So unless you're proposing a federal law against having babies, again, it's a weird reason

In industrialized nations, overpopulation is effectively a non-issue.","Well, your view seems to be based on the idea that overpopulation is a significant issue, so I'll challenge that:

In industrialized nations, overpopulation is effectively a non-issue. Most actually have a fertility rate well below the replacement rate; in some countries, like Japan and Italy, this is gradually becoming a demographic crisis. In countries with low birth rates, the high average age of the population means that eventually, there will not be a large enough working age population to support the post-working age population. This is already what would be the case in Europe if it weren't for immigration providing an influx of working-age people. Many governments have had to take action on this crisis, especially Japan, which has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, has a drastically decreasing population, and will have a majority of its population over 65 by 2060.

So, in reality, you don't have to worry all that much about the impact of bringing a child into the world. Take steps to reduce your children's footprint, and you'll be fine.

Additionally, adoption and biological children aren't an either/or situation. You're right that adopting may be morally preferable to having a biological child, but you can do both. Nothing about choosing to adopt precludes you from having biological children, and vice versa.",3340.0,Assumption,1,130,2022-05-07T14:50:46.257338Z,2022-05-07T14:50:46.257338Z,85915.0

I think that there is a good chance for a breach of contract case, unless when buying the ticket they agreed to the provision that they might be booted due to a practice of overbooking. If that is the case, then they both willingly entered into the contract with that provision and possibility spelled out.

Overbooking is in most cases a victimless crime. That is to say, in most cases, even though flights are overbooked, nobody has to leave the plane.

t3_64kkxe,dg3cm1o,"I see that your view has already been changed, but I thought I'd chime in with some additional info regarding flyer's rights in the US.","I see that your view has already been changed, but I thought I'd chime in with some additional info regarding flyer's rights in the US.  According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.  This is due to the regulations around involuntary bumping.  

Involuntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.  Any more than 2 hours incurs a 400% penalty that the carrier must pay to the customer.  This is all to protect the customer from overzealous overbooking.  The official rules are a bit more nuanced than my synopsis, and you can read them in their entirety here: https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights

According to the US Department of Transport, there are two kinds of acceptable ""bumping"" from overbooked flights: voluntary and involuntary.  Voluntary bumping is the most frequent type, and this is what you normally see when the airline offers you incentives to voluntarily take a later flight.  Carriers are given a lot of freedom in how they negotiate with passengers in order to get volunteers, but it is frequently in the carrier's interest to get volunteers.

Involuntary bumping requires the airline to arrange alternative travel arrangements that get the customer to their intended destination within 1 hour of their original scheduled arrival time.  If the customer arrives between 1 and 2 hours late, the carrier is forced to pay significant penalties to the customer for the inconvenience.

Let's say the last two flights of the day to Alaska from LA leave at 8:00pm and 9:00pm.  Both of these flights have five available seats.  
  
There's passengers landing in LA that need to get on one of those two flights to Alaska, arriving on two different planes in LA at 7:00pm and 7:10pm, each with 5 passengers.  
  
So how should we schedule this?  Obviously put the people on the 7:00pm arrival onto the 8:00pm departure and the 7:10pm arrival on the 9:00pm departure.  That way there's no overbooking.  No problemo.

But is there a solution to this?  Yes!  Overbook EVERYONE on the 8:00pm flight so that flight is 5 seats overbooked and the 9:00pm flight is underbooked.  When the first flight is late, the 7:10pm arrivers get on the 8:00pm flight and the 7:00pm plane that actually arrived at 8:10pm gets its passengers on the later flight.  And EVERYONE gets to Alaska that day because overbooking saved the day.
  
Of course this usually means 5 people will get bumped from the 8:00pm flight to the 9:00pm flight.  Most likely they'll find volunteers to do it for $150.  But that's totally fine.

Does this indicator give a 100% guarantee that more educated people have more correct political views? Or is it only a probable indication?

If you want to say it's a 100% accurate indication, I'd argue that that's impossible. How can we prove for a fact that higher-educated people, whose minds we can't see inside of, are always more concerned with being correct about everything than less educated people? How do we know that they don't base their beliefs on what most appeals to them, and then use their intelligence to argue for their predetermined conclusions? There could be something about being educated that makes certain viewpoints seem more appealing on a gut level, and this seems especially true when it comes to ones that have altruistic motivations. 

The real deciding factor has to be the actual logic and arguments behind the different views. And if this is the case, I'm not sure how many people would actually disagree with you.

My country, the US, well, we used guns to free ourself from your royalty. They tried to stop us with guns. Had we not been allowed to own guns, we couldn't have won our freedom. So, for obvious reasons, we are not keen on having our current government take our guns and keep guns for themselves.

Period. The relative size of the country and the fact that it's fairly manageable to track weapons coming in via ships, planes, or the english channel (chunnel? I forget the exact name) is a huge factor in why England is able to function well with guns being outlawed. It's remarkably more difficult for traffickers to transport illegal guns to the UK than it would be for them to bring guns to a larger country like the US, which has long borders with Canada and Mexico.

It is a space dedicated to the discussion about religion and it does seem a bit open to different ideas, but if I went into Christianity I would wonder if they would be as cool for divergent viewpoints and if they were I would imagine I could find a sub group of  Christians who created an even different ubber Christian only focused group. 

If there is a super Christian group wouldn't they not be able to discuss things if atheists and people who disagreed with them just invaded their space over and over and over again. 

I full disclosure, I'm atheist myself and I've never spent any time on religious subs, but I'm sure they are out there. 


And well almost a better point, I've heard my gay friends how strangers, today, think it is okay to pray for them or to judge them because they are gay. Is a place where it is fine to be gay really a bad idea. ",4771.0,None,1,657,2022-05-08T10:04:21.936137Z,2022-05-08T10:04:21.936137Z,37674.0

Do you think that the average person is exposed to varying different viewpoints throughout their day? They aren't.

Most of my peers did ""practical"" majors and are working in similar jobs to the one I've done without college, doing something totally unrelated to their degree, or have exactly the high power job they wanted and no anticipation for the future. My dad is one of the latter and his misery has poisoned the whole family in spite of our relative financial security. As long as you are employable you will be secure, but happiness is essential for a good life. Look at the other reddit thread running right now on kings who abdicated their thrones for modest lives.

Guessing what technologies are going to be invented or adopted in an industry is basically gambling with your future, but at this point I have no real solution to address the wasted time, money and credit-hours of a person who studied for a major only to have their industry or part obsoleted. 
  
Another problem your OP doesn't address is that something like 25% of all college graduates end up in a job directly in line with the major they graduated with.  This would seem like a major misallocation of resources.",4965.0,Assumption,1,739,2022-05-08T11:15:28.897327Z,2022-05-08T11:15:28.897327Z,19079.0

If i have a job that i really enjoy (which is currently my case), after my 8 hour day, i had a lot of fun. I enjoyed my day. At the end of the week, i don't need to go out and do anything to be happier, i already enjoyed my week. I may have made a bit less, but i don't need to spend anything as a result so it's not such a big difference. Not only that, but i work side jobs in my field on my spare time. Since i love my job, it makes me even happier to go out and work, while making even more money. So in the end, I'm being paid to have fun on my time off that i spend with friends. 

Not to mention the fact that i love my job means im always looking for new ways to improve my work, always willing and eager to learn. It makes me very valuable to employers. As others have mentioned, it gives you security. And i still make as much per year as someone who makes more but doesn't enjoy their job as much.

These two ideas seem completely incompatible with one another to me.  Doesn't it have to be one or the other?",5750.0,None,1,1062,2022-05-08T13:38:12.569815Z,2022-05-08T13:38:25.609303Z,14320123.0

I agree with you that a lot of debate on this subject is just talking without listening, but it doesn't have to be that way. People can be swayed.",6234.0,Continue,1,1317,2022-05-08T15:26:29.786323Z,2022-05-08T15:26:29.786323Z,3661.0

There's a common illusion at work here. The illusion that nobody ever changes their mind on the internet.

The people I argued with about religion have absolutely no clue what an impact they had on my worldview in both the short and long term.

If you need proof that minds can change, look no further than the rise of atheism/agnosticism since the invention of the internet.

t3_61gkuk,dfg7esn,The main danger l see with this is the potential for murder.,"The main danger l see with this is the potential for murder. In general, most humane civilised people, whom are not suffering from a psychological disorder that numbs their apathetic emotions, will agree that a innocent life taken without consent by another human is murder. 
Since we can not ask (or know) what humans with certain limiting conditions want, we can not make a life or death judgement.

Experiencing compassion like that for another human is a very powerful thing, and can lead to a lot of personal growth. Seeing the strength of the family caring for that person, and the hardships that they choose to endure.

Growth comes from adversity. Life is not all sunshine and sprinkles, sometimes its hard. Really fucking hard. Learning to deal with that is valuable.

My family used to have a disabled member in it, and the hardships of that and the personal growth lead to 3 generations of women realising the strength of compassion and their love of giving to others. They all became nurses, and effected positive change in the lives of thousands of people. Without the experiences of caring for a disabled person that might not have happened.

You say it doesn't make sense to you, but that feeling is also valuable. To realise that sometimes people do seemingly crazy things with no obvious pay off, simply because they are loving  caring people and they value family more than anything else in the world. Its a beautiful thing.

t3_6r0yd5,dl1wv3v,I'm a Korean with a greencard.,"I'm a Korean with a greencard. I moved to the US when I was 9 then went back to Korea for my high school, then came back to the US for university. In total, I've spent about 7 or 8 years in the states.

I would consider myself pretty well ""Americanized"". My English is better than my Korean, I have no accent whatsoever, and I'm culturally more familiar with the US than with Korea. 

Perhaps the people that surrounded us were different (I lived in Northern California and Upstate New York), but I've never been called FOB, chink, or any other derogatory term in my time here in the States. In fact, due to my joking nature, I've called white people crackers and my black friends niggas in friendly manners (probably not that sensitive, but I was young and they were good friends.)

Something that differentiates my experience from yours, from what I've read, is that you tried hard to assimilate and abandon your Korean identity, while I embraced it and used it as part of my character. Surrounded by white kids in a suburban environment, I found being Korean was something that made me unique and gave me a sense of identity, and I often incorporated my nationality into conversations (perhaps a little too much, which I still cringe at to this day.)

Even today, the only people that have ever given me shit for being an Asian were other Asians, ironically. 너무 백인들이랑 흑인들을 멀리서보지말고 친구로보면 더 어울릴꺼 같습니다.",6669.0,Anecdote,1,1471,2022-05-08T16:19:23.660997Z,2022-05-08T16:19:23.660997Z,10331.0

&gt;In terms of cost effectiveness, alcohol beats therapy

In terms of effectiveness, alcohol seems like a snooze button. You want to say Fuck It, This Shit Sucks, but you don't say it and instead you let that feeling simmer in a soup of alcohol and procrastination. 

Alcohol doesn't resolve anything. It only makes your eyes go hazy. If you close your eyes when your hand is on fire, your hand will still be burning.

&gt;In terms of effort, it beats Zen.

Yeah in terms of effort, alcohol is no effort at all. You need effort to accomplish things though. That feeling of inner peace you speak of is called complacency. That's not Zen. It does not beat Zen. 

&gt;Without alcohol, I think about these things regularly- with it, they are just illusions, phenomena of a world that is dying along with me.

Think about them. The pain you feel is the hint of progress. Don't avoid the pain — feel it, think about it. You can call these things of life illusion but, just like the fire which is burning your hand, they are only metaphorical illusions. 

&gt; As I watch myself allegedly deteriorate

Not allegedly. It sounds like you're pursuing a plan of steady deterioration. I've done that before. Then I stopped because I felt deteriorated and wanted more than that.

You should find a better solution than alcohol. Find a hobby. Find people. Find Art. Maybe be like Jim Carrey and seek some color. You can even keep drinking, ain't nothing wrong with that.

In terms of effectiveness, alcohol seems like a snooze button. You want to say Fuck It, This Shit Sucks, but you don't say it and instead you let that feeling simmer in a soup of alcohol and procrastination. 

Alcohol doesn't resolve anything. It only makes your eyes go hazy. If you close your eyes when your hand is on fire, your hand will still be burning.

&gt;In terms of effort, it beats Zen.

Yeah in terms of effort, alcohol is no effort at all. You need effort to accomplish things though. That feeling of inner peace you speak of is called complacency. That's not Zen. It does not beat Zen. 

&gt;Without alcohol, I think about these things regularly- with it, they are just illusions, phenomena of a world that is dying along with me.

Think about them. The pain you feel is the hint of progress. Don't avoid the pain — feel it, think about it. You can call these things of life illusion but, just like the fire which is burning your hand, they are only metaphorical illusions.

With drinking, as soon as you sober up your problems are still there.  If drinking is going to be your coping mechanism you must do it forever.  You can't ever stop because once you do your problems come back.  You will wake up in a couple decades at best where you are today, and if you want to keep getting the same effect you'll need to just keep going.  Eventually you will absolutely pass the cost of therapy, without question.  60 drinks a week, even if they are cheap drinks (let's say a buck a bottle) is basically the cost of a therapy sessions once every two weeks.

You’re drinking enough to build up a really really high tolerance. Eventually the alcohol will not work like it used to and your brain will physically start to produce less dopamine with that level of consumption. 

This means that the mental issues your trying to bandaid will get worse over time. That said, you’re not going to notice the slow gradual change because you’re too drunk to notice. You’ll notice when it’s too late. As hard as you think things used to be, recovery is 10x harder.

- “Hangovers” that are cured by consuming more alcohol. 
- Shaking / sweating / nausea... feeling like you’re getting “food poisoning” more often. 
- Gastritis. Shitting more. Having frequent diarrhea. 
- Rapid are labored heart rate.

Given the amount you’re drinking, and given that you have a day on and a day off, you should also be careful about seizures. Read up on these. They are very real and can kill you. When you do stop, don’t go cold turkey. Dial down over a few weeks or get medical help to avoid DT seizures.
