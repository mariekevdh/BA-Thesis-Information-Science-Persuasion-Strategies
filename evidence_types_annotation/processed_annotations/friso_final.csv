"What most pro-choicers tend to think is either that most fetuses aren't persons (since most abortions happen very early in pregnancies) and that, even if they were persons, the government's interest in protecting fetuses from abortion is outweighed by the right of the mother to her bodily autonomy.",Assumption,t3_6ihcuk,dj6bibk,1383.0,10414.0

The question of free will is separate from and irrelevant to the functioning of the Justice system for several reasons.,None,t3_4x7vi8,d6dd62j,3070.0,14658.0
