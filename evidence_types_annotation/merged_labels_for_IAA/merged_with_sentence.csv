"True, Google release ARCore around the same time and other companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm are making big strides in computer vision, but a lot of what Apple did was in house and to a higher standard, and naturally those R&amp;D costs are passed down to consumers in the cost of the phones.",Assumption,Assumption,Anecdote
